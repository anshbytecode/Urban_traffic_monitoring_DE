# Urban_traffic_monitoring_DE

This project provides a framework for monitoring urban traffic congestion using sample data and Python analytics.

Urban centers struggle with traffic congestion, resulting in longer travel times and increased pollution. The goal of this project is to ingest, process, and analyze traffic data to reveal key congestion patterns and provide actionable insights.
